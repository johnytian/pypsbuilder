Python API
==========

Both ``psbuilder`` and ``psexplorer`` expose several classes which could be used
in own scripts, interactively or in jupyter environment.

Check included `jupyter notebook <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ondrolexa/pypsbuilder/blob/develop/notebooks/pypsbuilder.ipynb>`_
to see how it works.

Here you can find auto-generated documentation of main classes, methods and
